## Introduction

*Intel&reg; Compute Libraries for GPU* (**iclGPU**) is a framework and repository for implementation of compute libraries (e.g. BLAS) accelerated using Intel&reg; Processor Graphics.
It provides ability to develop efficient and optimized kernels for Intel GPU and mechanism of their execution.

This technical preview includes **iclBLAS** - Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) implementation optimized for Intel&reg; GPU.

As with any technical preview, APIs may change in future updates.
